# Digit Recognition Project

This project implements a digit recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow for training and Pygame for visualizing and drawing digits. The system can recognize digits drawn on the screen by the user.

## Features
- **Neural Network:** Uses a CNN built with TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits (0-9).
- **Interactive Drawing:** Pygame is used for users to draw digits, which are then predicted by the trained model.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Pygame
- NumPy
